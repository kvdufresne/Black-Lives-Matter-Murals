      <p class="LatexTitle">Black Lives Matter Murals</p>
       <p class="LatexName">Downtown Raleigh, NC <br></p> 
       <p class="LatexDate">The following images are of murals and street art in downtown Raleigh, North Carolina, crafted by various artists, creators, and makers on brick and plywood. While made of various materials with different styles, these pieces of community-generated art all illustrate and amplify the important message that Black Lives Matter. Here, Slow looking is coupled with the murals to equip us with the opportunity to experience greater intentionality in sitting with these images, their messages, and the lived realities that they reflect and convey by slowly viewing the entirety of the mural and art.</p>

<p class="Section">&ensp;Slow looking with BLM Murals</p>
    <p class="BodyText"><a href="https://slowlooking.cogapp.com/">Slow looking</a> was developed by <a href="https://labs.cogapp.com/">Cogapp Labs</a> - where they identify that the application is “A relaxing full-screen immersive experience."

        Cogapp further expresses:
        
        “This relaxing full-screen immersive experience will slowly show your chosen image in detail. It takes a few rejuvenating minutes to complete, best enjoyed without distractions.”
        
        But how can Slow looking give us an opportunity to sit with images and art that was created with temporary materials with messages that carry a long and painful history and remind us how that history and socio-political inequalities are still present and dangerous today?
        
        The following images are from various artists, creators, and makers and their murals and street art in downtown Raleigh, North Carolina. The Slow looking experience equips us with a greater intentionality in sitting with these images, their messages, and the lived realities that they reflect and convey by slowly viewing the entirety of the mural and art.
        
        As Cogapp suggests, view and experience these images without distractions. But instead of passively observing this immersive experience, pay attention to what you are seeing, thinking, and feeling. How do these images surprise, shock, challenge, ignite you?
