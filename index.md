# Downtown Raleigh Black Lives Matter Murals
## Slow looking with BLM Murals

[Slow looking](https://slowlooking.cogapp.com/) was developed by [Cogapp Labs](https://labs.cogapp.com/) - where they identify that the application is “A relaxing full-screen immersive experience.“

Cogapp further expresses: 
> “This relaxing full-screen immersive experience will slowly show your chosen image in detail. It takes a few rejuvenating minutes to complete, best enjoyed without distractions.”

But how can Slow looking give us an opportunity to sit with images and art that was created with temporary materials with messages that carry a long and painful history and remind us how that history and socio-political inequalities are still present and dangerous today?

The following images are from various artists, creators, and makers and their murals and street art in downtown Raleigh, North Carolina. The Slow looking experience equips us with a greater intentionality in sitting with these images, their messages, and the lived realities that they reflect and convey by slowly viewing the entirety of the mural and art.

As Cogapp suggests, view and experience these images without distractions. But instead of passively observing this immersive experience, pay attention to what you are seeing, thinking, and feeling. How do these images surprise, shock, challenge, ignite you? 

If you created one of the following murals and/or pieces of street art, please contact us here [link to google form or email] so that we can ensure you are credited with your work.
